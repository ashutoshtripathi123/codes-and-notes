1. Implement default constructor, destructor, assignment operator and copy constructor for a class having character pointer(This is must do question. Prepare well)
2. Difference between copy constructor and assignment operator
3. Operator overloading such as =, ++, --, New operator overload (Important)
4. Difference between new syntax   new int(4) and new int[4] ?
5. Class inheritance
6. Static member variable and member function properties such as why this pointer is not passed to static function etc
7. mutable and explicit usage
8. Deep understating of how Vtable is constructed ? (Most of the questions are based on this)
9. why Virtual constructor not possible but we can virtual destructor why ?
10. Use of virtual destructor ? Realtime usage ?
11. Design pattern (Singleton at least)
12. Logical questions based on Linked list such as reversal, intersection etc
13. What is data abstraction and data hiding (Real time example is must. Prepare well)
14. C++11 features such as Initializer list, Auto keyword, Smart pointer (Good to have), nullptr, range based loops
15. STL questions such as container(map, vector, list etc ..) their properties. Writing and reading form container
16. Exception handling (Important)
17. Threading and synchronization 
18. How to make sure that object would not be created on stack ?
