-> libraries to be used Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, statsmodel, sklearn, etc.
-> we need anaconda python distribution. goto anaconda prompt there are 2 installers available for installing a library and it is pip and conda
-> work in  a new virtual environment by default anaconda provides (base) environment 
#conda create --name quant python=3.8 -> for creating a new environment 
#conda activate quant 
#conda deactivate
#conda info --envs -> this is to get the list of envs installed in our system 
#conda install pandas==0.24.1 -> for specifying exact version to be installed    
-> so now after activating quant I install any library using pip then that library will be installed in quant environment only.
-> we installed spyder IDE inside quant environment
-> yfinance will be used for getting data from yahoo finance instead of pandas data reader as it is no more supported 
-> instead of hardcoding date we will use the library datetime   
-> Pandas DataFrame will be used a lot, hence familarize yourself with it 
->Format of yfinance.download is ::: 
  yfinance.download("ticker code", start="", end="", interval="")
-> yahoofinancial is another alternative to yfinance.
   its better to have alternatives as we do not know when it will get unsupported
-> yahoofinancial uses web scrapping instead of using the API's provided by yahoo 
-> the granularity in yahoofinancial is at the atleast 1D, so it cannot be used to obtain intraday data 
->strftime converts datetime object into a string
-> DataFrame is a 2-dimensional heterogenous data type holder. pass it any idctionary, and it will arrange the data where columns will be keys, and values will form row 

-> alpha vantage is another website which provides free data, it even provides technical indicators. however unlike yfinance we need API key to use this 
-> Welcome to Alpha Vantage! Your dedicated access key is: BVR2LVGG6HZTJ1VJ. Please record this API key at a safe place for future data access.
-> it has tons of data, but there is one problem, we cannot make more than 5 calls per minute, which means we cannot fetch data in one short for 10 or more tickers.
to address this problem, we wont use the API's provided by them, instead we will use a alpha vantage wrapper developed by RomelTorres

rolling mean = moving averages 

-> in stock market, we do not look at the stock price, but what we look at is daily return REMEMBER THIS
-> most technical indicators are lagging indicators - used to confirm trends 
-> typically TI are used in conjunction with other TI 
-> in finance standard deviation is the proxy or alias of volatility 
-> ADX is Average Directional Index - it tells about the trend. if less than 25 then false trend, and anything above that is good as high as it goes 
-> coding renko is difficult, so we will use a library which is already present in    
   github:https://github.com/ChillarAnand/stocktrends
->talib is a technical analysis library everything is precoded here.
it has an important function called as pattern recognition, which is widely used by traders everyday.
its not very accurate, Sir doesnt use it https://mrjbq7.github.io/ta-lib/
-> CAGR = Cummulative Annual Growth Rate 
-> to annualize daily volatility multiply with sqrt(252) - typically there are 252 trading days in a year   
-> to annualize weekly volatility multiply with sqrt(52) - there are 52 trading weeks in a year 
-> to annualize monthly volatility multiply with sqrt(12) - there are 12 trading months in a year

sharpe ratio : is widly used in finance industry. it tells the average return earned in excess of the risk free rate per unit of volatility
sharpe ratio = (expected return - risk free return)/std deviation of asset return 
sortino ratio = (expected return - risk free return)/std deviation of negative return
highest drawdown = Difference between the highest high and the lowest low during the time holding asset 
calmar ratio = CAGR/maximum drawdown
