========== udemy notes ======================
-> File->New->Module->Java Module. Then select package instead of project, and you will see your Java class
-> new package can also be used to create folders in you're project
-> type psvm, and it will expand to public static void main(), and psfi to expand it to public static final int. Similarly for psfs for string
-> when declaring a float, append a 'f' to differentiate it with double
-> largest number a byte can hold is 127. a short is twice the size of byte
-> System.out.println(class object); //prints the address of the object
-> Alt+Insert, and you can auto generate the constructor, getter and setter
-> CTRL+SHIFT+/ => can be used for multiple lines commenting
->sout + TAB -> for System.out.println();
-> if you override toString function, you can just pass object, and print whatever you want, i.e. all required attribute of the class
   to do this: Alt+Insert, select toString, voila
-> all classes inherit from Object
-> One more alternate to OnClickListener is to make an entry in the xml, i.e. android:onClick=<some function name>
   and create this function in you're class file
-> another way is to do: trueButton.setOnClickListener(this); Click on red bulb, and implement the button onClick function.
   now this function can be used to listen to all the button clicks for all the buttons. Best approach if u have more than 1 button    
-> Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(),R.string.app_name, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
-> Snackbar.make(view, "Replace with your own action", Snackbar.LENGTH_LONG).setAction("Action", null).show();
-> snackbar is similar to toast, only difference is that it is linked to a view, and shows full line. its like toast 2.0
-> goto res->values->colors.xml, add ur own myColor, for value type #CED, one rectangle will get drawn, use it for color options
-> add uses permission in AndroidManifest file, to prompt user for what all permissions my app needs
-> res->layout-> added a new layout. and added it in setContentView. Now my app on loading will show this layout
-> java->com.example.activitylifecycle->right click->new->activity->empty activity. for one more activity/screen
lifecycle of an android app: onCreate, onStart, onResume, onPause, onStop, onDestroy
We need to override these functions to access these states, Alt+Insert->override methods->select onPause
-> when adding a plain text, you can even add hint, but after removing the default text
-> Intent is to be used when from one activity you want to go to another activity.
   Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, ShowGuess.class);//from class this, to class that
   startActivity(intent);
   startActivityForResult(intent, REQUEST_CODE); //if you are expecting any result back from the second class 
-> we can also send data from MainActivity class, by appending data to intent, example:
   intent.putExtra("guess", "Hello There"); and it can be received in ShowGuess class as:
   String value = getIntent().getStringExtra("guess");
-> but say suppose from MainActivity you are sending many strings, and integers, in that case its better to keep a bundle in receiving class as:
   Bundle extra = getIntent().getExtras();
   and retrieve everything thind like:
   extra.getInt("age"), or extra.getString("name")
   Remember, the procedure to send from MainActivity still remains the same i.e. intent.putExtra(key and value)
-> once the work of the second activity is done, it is better to call finish() at the end of the activity function
-> if you want to send data from second activity to first, then remember to do the following in second class:
	Intent intent = getIntent();
	intent.putExtra("message_back", "From Second Activity");
	setResult(RESULT_OK, intent);
    and in the receiving class, override onActivityResult to get the result back. Use the same request code
	used when we called startActivityForResult
-> volley - to communicate with the web. add the following in gradle scripts->build.gradle(module:app) in dependencies:
	implementation 'com.android.volley:volley:1.1.1'
	another way to add it is: File->Project Structure->Dependencies->Apps->Add/Delete Library 
*** Since we are fetching data from Internet, don't forget to add this to the AndroidManifest file:
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
-> "MainActivity.this" or "this" is same as this.getApplicationContext()
-> for saving user information we have 3 types to do it: Text File, Shared Preferences, Database
for smaller piece of data used shared preferences
For saving in shared preferences, at the end, you need to do edit.apply() compulsarily
-> since in android shared Preferences is stored as xml on disk, it is required to provide an id to it
-> to see that shared preferences is working in our app, input some value, press the button, clear the app, and start it again.
   you should see that same value being retained
   These shared preferences are stored as map, and can be seen in Device Folder->Data->Data->app-><you're app>->shared_prefs
======= Tivia App ======
-> we created folders in our project to keep the files in an organized way by app->java->com.app.tivia->right click->new->package
-> while creating AppController class, we gave super class as android.app.Application, because we want it to override certain methods of class Application
-> For TAG in debugs better to use this: <class name>.class.getSimpleName();
-> we added android:name=".Controller.AppController" in AndroidManifest, to tell Android that this class will govern the whole app,
   and should be available across
->What was the need to create an interface callback AnswerListAsyncResponse, and call it from MainActivity.java
  its simple. Accessing Internet to get data can be slow, can happen in the background, and meanwhile we can 
  proceed with our other stuff. With this callback mechanism, we assure that once it has got all its data, give it back 
  to the callback declared
-> animation can be created either through code or xml
   In res, right click, resource folder, and select anim 
   Inside anim folder, right click, new, Animation resource file 
============ Contact Manager App ===================
-> For inserting into the map, we need something like a structure. we could have used a map, but ContentValues is recommended
-> For reading from DB, we use Cursor, similar to iterator in c++
   example:     Cursor cursor = db.query(Util.TABLE_NAME,
                new String[]{ Util.KEY_ID, Util.KEY_NAME, Util.KEY_PHONE_NUMBER},
                Util.KEY_ID +"=?",new String[]{String.valueOf(id)},
                null, null, null);
				if (cursor != null)
					cursor.moveToFirst();
-> =? means, the next parameter will is the input, and should be considered for match.
-> res->layout->right click new layout resource file. we will create a new XML for each entry of the list.
-> recyclerView is better than listView. one of the usecase is scrollable list
with recyclerView you can even use animation/cardView etc. so this should
always be preferred, and it also has a boost in performance.
-> refer to this link for extra info on recyclerView: https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Using-the-RecyclerView
================== Baby Need App ======================
-> we can include one xml into another by including the following line in parent xml:
<include layout="@layout/content_main" />
-> to create popup we need AlerDialog.Builder and AlertDialog, then do the following steps:
        builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this);
        View view = getLayoutInflater().inflate(R.layout.popup, null);
		builder.setView(view);
        dialog = builder.create(); //Creating dialog object
        dialog.show();
-> to write into DB, we need to get its handler in writable mode, which is done as:
    SQLiteDatabase db = this.getWritableDatabase();

-> Lesson: if I have created a button in some other xml, then I cannot doa findViewById in onCreate of MainActivity
   it has to be done somewhere else, after getting the view of the inflated xml
-> Lesson: the order in which DB is created, the same order should be followed when accessing or insertinf values from DB
           If you're making any change in that order, then change the DB version

-> Whenever you want a delay, use this:
        new Handler().postDelayed(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {

            }
        },1200);//1sec
-> Baby need app was always opening with a new entry for popup, so as to avoid that, we changed the AndroiManifest file
 manifest has the name of the class that should be executed first. so if we change that, and write some other class, then during the 
 start of the application, that class will get executed.
 -> startActivity(new Intent(ListActivity.this, ListActivity.class));
    since we are starting same activity from self, we need to finish the previous instance, hence we call finish() function after this call
	finish() is also called in case if you want to finish the present activity and start a new one
-> to get the position of pointer, we use getAdapterPosition()
	this will tell where user has clicked, and then we can fetch the item like this:
	int position = getAdapterPosition();
	Item item = itemList.get(position);
-> If you are updating the Database, then the view requires to be updated too to show the change,
For this, call either of these functions:
notifyItemRemoved(getAdapterPosition());
notifyItemChanged(getAdapterPosition(), item);

code style -> anonymous inner classes for listeners

> by default activity layout defines 2 widgets, 1) relativeLayout, and the other is TextView.

relative layout comprises of the whole page, we dont want it that way, i.e. our QuizActivity needs 5 layouts:
1)a vertical layout
2) a TextView
3)a horizontal LinearLayout
4)two buttons

LayoutWidth, LayoutHeight:
match parent = fill parent = full screen, as big as parent
wrap content = as much as the content needs space
android:layout_marginTop="15dp" >> leave space from the top
android:centerHorizontal=true >> places ur widget in center, on horizontal axis
android:layout_below="@+id/topTextInput" >> places ur widget below the widget with id = toptextInput
android:orientation="horizontal/vertical". for example by default linear layout places everything side by side. by changing
orientation to vertical, it places everything column wise
android:textSize="15sp" //for text we use sp and not dp


LinearLayout inherits from a view subclass called as viewGroup. You use LinearLayout when u want to arrange your widget in a single column or row. Other subclasses of viewgroup are FrameLayout, TableLayout and RelativeLayout

FrameLayout: Simplest of the ViewGroup. It doesnot arrange children in any particular order, instead child views will be arranged as per :
	     android:layout_gravity. Also container group for holding fragments.

GridLayout: row span = u tell the cell to take space of how many rows. similar description goes for column span as well.


Padding:
This attribute tells the widget to add specified amount of space

android:text-
string resource resides in a different xml file in resource called as strings.xml, if you want it to be hardcoded, do as follows:
android:tex="True"
But its a good idea to keep ur string at one place.
do not delete the menu_settings from strings.xml

android:drawableRight=@drawable/arrow_right & android:drawablePadding="4dp"
android:contentDescription="Read out the content of the string, incase when ur using imageButton"

To access a resouce in code, we use its resource id. The resource id of the layout can be accessed by:
R.layout.activity_quiz
Resource id for text widget will be: R.string.question_text
These resource id's can be seen in the file R.java
Now resource id is not generated for all widgets. If you want it to be generated for your widget, just include id attribute in its xml i.e. activity_quiz.xml.
Since we are going to interact with our app using these buttons, they need IDs
eg: there was no id for buttons, so we included android:id="@+id/true_button" 
Notice the + sign in the values for android:id but not in the values for android:text. This is because we are creating the IDs and only referencing the strings.

Wiring up the widgets to code is a two step process:
>get references to the inflated view objects
> set listeners on those objects

Getting reference to the inflated view objects:
mTrueButton = (Button)findViewById(R.id.true_button);
The casting done to the return type of findViewById is compulsary.

======================================For creating a dynamic interface, the activity has to be made in java and not xml file.================================
eg. of creating a widget in java:
Button redButton = new Button(this); //will have to do -> import android.widget.Button;
redButton.setId(1); //we need to set the ID to the resource for it can be used elsewhere
eg. of creating a new layout in java:
RelativeLayout rl = new RelativeLayout(this); // will have to do -> import android.widget.RelativeLayout;
rl.addView(redButton); OR rl.addView(redButton, buttonDetails); //adding button widget to the layout, this is done so that my layout has something to show
setContentView(rl);
removed setContentView to activity_main.xml from MainActivity.java, and instead placed setContentView(rl)

>we're going to prepare a container, and put it at the place where we want, this is done by calling:
relativeLayout.layoutParams buttonDetails = new relativeLayout.LayoutParams(...,...);
userNameDetails.addRule(RelativeLayout.ABOVE, redButton.getId()); //this will place it above the redButton, thats why we need the ID
buttonDetails.addRule(RelativeLayout.CENTER_HORIZONTAL); 

//converting DP to PIXEL; its needed because set width API needs input only in pixel.
//libraries needed for this are android.content.res.Resources; and android.util.TypedValues;
Resources r = getResources();//can be used to fetch all device and app parameters or values.
int px = (int) typedValues.applyDimension(TypedValue.COMPLEX_UNIT_DIP,200, r.getDisplayMetric());//DIP means, i want to perform operation related to DIP


=============================================================================================================================================================

android.graphic.color; //for importing and using colors

Setting listeners:
mTrueButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener())
{}

> Resources like images kept in res/drawable automatically gets the resource id.
> copy all ur images from source to local directory, do not link it

> CTRL+F12 to rotate the screen on emulator

> onTouchEvent gets called by default whenever the user touches the screen

Search and study about anonymous inner class, Context from Java
Definning an array in Java can be done using 2 techniques:
1) datatype [] varName = new datatype[size];
2) datatype [] varName = {var1, var2, ...};
java.utils.array; //library has all the functions needed for searching, sorting, filling, etc.
java.util.scanner; //for getting user input
java.util.*;//all java libraries

eg. of getting a user input:
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
a = in.nextIn();// will get the user integer input, for float use in.getFloat and etc. for each and every data type

There can be only one public class per source file.

A source file can have multiple non public classes.

The public class name should be the name of the source file as well which should be appended by .java at the end. For example : The class name is . public class Employee{} Then the source file should be as Employee.java.

>Passing array to a function can be done as >> printArray(new int[]{3, 1, 2, 6, 4, 2});

> The variable declared as final, is as good as constant. A final variable unitialised can be given
value only in constructor.
byte data type takes value from -28 to 128.
> anything defined as protected is accessible to the entire package - eg. src is a package.
> double.toString(doubt a), int.toString(int b), byte.toString(byte c) -> converts the input datatype to string.
>Integer.parseInt(string) -> similarly converts a string to integer

> android.util.Log has various log utilities. the one that we are going to use is:

Starting an Activity:
> The simplest way to start an activity from another is by calling the API startActivity(Intent intent). This API will tell the activityManager to start 
  the given activity.

>An intent is an object that a component uses to communicate with the OS. Whenever u want to request the OS to do something, we use Intent. in this case,
we are requesting the activityManager to create a new activity, so we use Intent(Context, class) where context is telling which package we can find the class object.
and class is the activity that the activityManager should start.

> A fragment is a controller  obect that the activity can deputize to perform tasks. a fragment managing user interface will be called as UI Fragment.
A fragment has its own view, which inflates from layout file. so that means it will have its own xml file, and java class compulsarily. an activity can have one or several fragments.
eg: Tab based interface can be implemented using fragments.
A fragment cannot display a view of its own on the screen, it needs to be listed in the activities hierarchy. 
an activity provides a spot in its view, where the fragment can place its own view.

> for compatibility with lower subclass, we subclassed fragmentActivity

>the fragment lifecycle is managed by activity lifecycle, and not the OS.
> two approaches of hosting the UI Fragment in an activity.
 1) add fragment to activity's layout. but this is not flexible, as activity's view = fragment's view.Its done using layout fragment
2) adding fragment in activity's code. this offers true flexibility.


> fragment transactions are used to add, remove, attach, detach fragments to the fragment list. They are the heart of how fragments are composed, recomposed to change
screen runtime.

> the onAttach(activity), onCreate(its public in fragments, unlike private in activity), onCreateView methods are called when we add a fragment to the fragmentManager.

>getting fragment manager for pre honeycomb:
FragmentManager fm = getSupportFragmentManager(); for post honeycomb, it should be getFragmentManager();

> for storing the crimeList, we create a singleton class. The singleton class creates only one instance, and it exists in memory as long as the app is alive no matter 
what its activity, fragment, or lifecycle state it is in. how do we create a singleton class ? simple by having a private constructor, and a get function.
Having a context in singleton allows to start activities, access prj resource, app's private storage, etc.

>You are not going to override onCreateView(…) or inflate a layout for
CrimeListFragment. The default implementation of a ListFragment inflates a layout that
defines a full-screen ListView, and you will use this layout for now.

> SingleFragmentActivity.java is our generic abstract class, created for code reuse. since a lot of code is generic when creating a new activity.

Whom does the ListView ask? It asks its adapter. An adapter is a controller object that sits
between the ListView and the data set containing the data that the ListView should display.
The adapter is responsible for creating the necessary view object populating it with data from the model layer returning the view object to the ListView

ArrayAdapter knows how to work with ArrayList
ArrayList is a java class, that supports ordered list of object of a given type, and methods for retriving adding and deleting elements.

RecyclerView has replaced adapterView or listView as it has lot of performance improvement.
it is more customizable, hence prefer to use RecyclerView instead of listView

SingleFragmentActivity = CrimeActivity OR CrimeListActivity
Since CrimeActivity AND CrimeListActivity has almost same generic code except for creation of new CrimeFragment, we can create an abstract class
i.e. SingleFragmentAcitivity which can be used by both CrimeActivity AND CrimeListActivity
