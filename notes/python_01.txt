'in' keyword:
in keyword can be used for parsing through the list or a range of numbers, for example:
var list_item in item -> here item is a list

'range' keyword:
for i in range(2,14): i will take the value from 2 to 13

'len' keyword:
expenses = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]
length = len(expenses) -> this will give the size of expenses array. it can used as index in for loop

using append to attach a new item to the list:
a = list()
a.append(1)
a.append(2)
a.append(3)

For inserting values in a dictionary
a = dict() ##this tells python interpreter that we are going to create a new dictionary 
a[1] = 10
a[2] = 20
a[3] = 30

break and continue can be used the same way as done in cpp

-> For documenting help of a function, just type ''' or """ then press enter. automatically functions input and return type will be added,
now you just need to add some text regarding what should be the value, and what it does

-> for storing data in doctionary, we need key value pair.
a dictionary is similar to Map, HashTable
For retreving data from list, we use index, but in case of dictionary we use key 
in dictionary order does not matter 
eg: dic = {"ram":123, "sita":456}

syntax for creating empty dictionary
d1 = dict()

-> tuples and string are immutable, i.e. they cannot be changed

-> the finally block in the exception handling will get executed, even if exception is there or not

How to know what all built in facilities I can use on example:
a = [1,2,3]
There is a command dir(a) -> on doing this it will print all the functionalites
which can be performed on list
