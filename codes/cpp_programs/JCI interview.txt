1. Static & dynamic linking
2. Virtual mechanism & effect of access specifier on it - No effect as at run time no access specifier is present
3. Semaphore & mutex internal implementation
4. Uml diagram
5. IPC mechanisms
6. Oops 5 points - I told only 4
7. Implement singleton pattern
8. Any design pattern in current project
9. Default methods provided by compiler - I told 4 but he asked for one more
10. Combining C & C++ code what care must be taken ? 
11. Structure padding & is it present in C++
12. Diff between Structure & class
13. Macro to get 2nd nibble from given number
14. Difference between vector & arrays
15. Questions on client server communication & synchronization
16. Volatile in C
17. Which compiler provided default implementations can be inherited
18. Process creates 3 threads & dies immediately what will happen to those threads ? How it can be avoided 
19. Need of virtual destructor 
20. Vtable & Vptr
21. Size of class having just hifour virtual function = 8 bytes, dont know why
22. 


Prepare Permanently -
1. IPC mechanismsÂ 
2. Design pattern
3. Complex Data structure
4. Usage of mutex & semaphore
5. Use of all major STL containers
6. Use of template programming
